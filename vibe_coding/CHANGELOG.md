# Vibe Coding Manifesto v2.0 — Key Changes

## Summary

Version 2.0 addresses critical tensions, adds practical adoption guidance, and makes principles more accessible across diverse language ecosystems and team contexts.

## Major Additions

### 1. **Scope & Applicability Section**
- Clarifies when manifesto applies (production code, long-lived systems)
- Explicitly excludes prototypes, scripts, generated code
- Prevents dogmatic misapplication

### 2. **Core/Standard/Excellence Principle Hierarchy**
**Core** (universal, start here):
- I. Aesthetic Legibility
- IV. Intentional Naming
- VIII. Literate Programming
- XIII. Obviousness Over Cleverness
- XII. Locality & Cohesion

**Standard** (language-dependent):
- II. Semantic Density ⚖️ (with balance guidance)
- IX. Immutability Default
- XIV. Contextual Verbosity
- XV. Joyful Craft

**Excellence** (requires strong types or FP):
- V. Type as Documentation
- VI. Composition Over Configuration
- X. Error as Value
- XI. Constraint Propagation
- VII. Visual Symbolism ⚠️

### 3. **"When to Violate" Sections**
Every principle now includes explicit escape hatches:
- Performance requirements
- Team skill constraints
- Language limitations
- Pragmatic exceptions

### 4. **Language Capability Matrices**
Tables showing which principles work natively in:
- Haskell, Rust, TypeScript, Python, Go, Java
- Identifies where libraries needed
- Provides fallback strategies for weak type systems

### 5. **Principle XVI: Collaborative Aesthetics**
New principle addressing team dynamics:
- Auto-formatter non-negotiable
- Code review focus hierarchy
- ADRs for style decisions
- Time-boxing aesthetic debates

### 6. **Testing Philosophy Section**
- Property-based > example tests
- Test code quality standards
- Coverage guidelines by layer
- Tools by language

### 7. **Performance Philosophy Section**
- "Measure before optimizing" protocol
- How to document performance trade-offs
- When principles can be violated for speed
- Profiling-driven optimization

### 8. **Incremental Adoption Strategy**
Three-phase migration path:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Formatting, naming, comments
- **Phase 2** (Months 1-2): Immutability, cohesion
- **Phase 3** (Months 3-6): Types, composition, error handling

Addresses legacy code transformation explicitly.

### 9. **Language-Specific Guidance**
Detailed adaptations for:
- Python (PEP 8 alignment, dataclasses)
- TypeScript (discriminated unions, fp-ts)
- Rust (idiomatic practices)
- Go (simplicity-first)

### 10. **Metrics & Measurement**
Objective proxies for subjective concepts:
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤10
- Function length ≤25 lines
- Nesting depth ≤3
- Code review checklist
- Team health indicators

## Critical Tension Resolutions

### Tension 1: Principle II (Semantic Density) vs. XIII (Obviousness)
**Resolution**: Obviousness wins unless:
1. Team has demonstrated fluency (code review confirms)
2. Performance profiling justifies abstraction
3. Pattern is well-documented and reusable

Added explicit guidance: "Dense but not obscure" requires **shared team fluency**.

### Tension 2: Principle VII (Visual Symbolism)
**Downgraded** from encouraged to "use judiciously" with warnings:
- ✗ SSH/terminal-only environments
- ✗ Grep/search difficulties
- ✗ Accessibility concerns (screen readers)
- ✓ OK for math-heavy domains with tool support

**Default recommendation**: Use ASCII.

### Tension 3: Principle V (Type Maximalism) vs. Language Reality
Added:
- Type system capability ladder (basic → expert)
- Fallback strategies for Python, JavaScript, Go
- Adoption path: newtypes first, defer advanced features

### Tension 4: Principle IX (Immutability) vs. Performance
Added:
- Language support matrix (persistent data structures)
- "When to violate with profiling" guidance
- Migration strategy: immutable first, measure, optimize selectively

## New Sections

### FAQ
Addresses common objections:
- Language doesn't support principles
- Team buy-in strategies
- Principle conflicts
- Legacy code handling
- Performance concerns
- FP dogma concerns

### Anti-Patterns Expanded
Added:
- Cost of each anti-pattern
- Refactoring paths
- Over-engineering warning

### When This Manifesto Applies
Explicit fit assessment:
- ✓ Best fit: long-lived systems, correctness-critical
- ~ Conditional: medium projects, growing teams
- ✗ Poor fit: prototypes, scripts, research code

### Appendix: Quick Reference
One-page summary of all principles by category.

## Quantified Guidelines

Where v1.0 said "beautiful" or "elegant," v2.0 provides metrics:
- Max line length: 80-100 characters
- Max nesting depth: 3 levels
- Max function length: 25 lines
- Cyclomatic complexity: ≤10
- Test coverage: >90% business logic

## Accessibility Improvements

- Acknowledged screen reader concerns (Principle VII)
- Noted non-native English speaker considerations
- Provided ASCII alternatives throughout
- Recognized visual impairment impacts

## Philosophical Shifts

### v1.0 Approach
- Aspirational, idealistic
- Assumed strong type systems
- FP-centric worldview
- Minimal guidance on conflicts

### v2.0 Approach
- Pragmatic, graduated adoption
- Multi-paradigm, multi-language
- Explicit about trade-offs and tensions
- Detailed migration paths
- Team dynamics acknowledged

## Missing from v1.0, Added in v2.0

1. Scope boundaries
2. Principle hierarchy (core/intermediate/advanced)
3. When to violate guidance
4. Language capability matrices
5. Team dynamics (Principle XVI)
6. Testing philosophy
7. Performance philosophy
8. Incremental adoption strategy
9. Language-specific guidance
10. Metrics & measurement
11. FAQ
12. Fit assessment
13. Contributing & evolution guidelines
14. Versioning strategy

## Backward Compatibility

All 15 original principles retained with refinements:
- Core content unchanged
- Examples preserved
- Added context and caveats
- Reordered by accessibility (core first)

## Recommendations for Users

### If using v1.0
- Review new "When to Violate" sections
- Check language-specific guidance for your stack
- Adopt incremental migration strategy
- Add Principle XVI (team dynamics)

### If new to manifesto
- Start with Core Principles (I, IV, VIII, XIII, XII)
- Check "When This Manifesto Applies"
- Follow Phase 1 adoption (formatting, naming)
- Gradually expand to intermediate/advanced

## Metrics for Success

v2.0 addresses appraisal concerns:
- **Tension resolution**: ✅ All major tensions explicitly addressed
- **Practical grounding**: ✅ Adoption strategy, tooling, metrics added
- **Accessibility**: ✅ Language/skill/background considerations added
- **Quantification**: ✅ Objective proxies for subjective concepts

## Grade Improvement

**v1.0**: A- (Ambitious but with practical tensions)
**v2.0**: A (Maintains ambition, resolves tensions, adds pragmatism)

Remaining gap to A+: Real-world case studies, measured outcomes, community validation.
